Python Tutorial for the Course [Computational modeling of nanosystems](https://barbatti.org/molecular-modeling/).

There are two tutorials: one with basic usage of python, from the types of variables up to creating
a script and plotting data read from a file; other with the application of python to solve a first
order ODE, both implementind Euler method and calling the scipy solver.

The notebooks can be downloaded from the github page to be run locally or can be run directly in 
google colab by following the link:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/rsmattos/Basic_python_toturial

and open one of the notebooks. When using colab, you'll have to log into a google account and 
upload the files:
- populations.dat
- plot_pop.py

to the colab space. More instructions can be found in: https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs442//WI2021/colab.html
